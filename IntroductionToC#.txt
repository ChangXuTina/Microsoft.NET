Understanding Data Types
Test your Knowledge

1. What type would you choose for the following “numbers”?
A person’s telephone number: string, might have special cases
A person’s height: int
A person’s age: int
A person’s gender (Male, Female, Prefer Not To Answer): string
A person’s salary: double or float
A book’s ISBNA book’s price: doulbe or float
A book’s shipping weight: double or float
A country’s population: int
The number of stars in the universe: long
The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the United Kingdom (up to about 50,000 employees per business): int

2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is boxing and unboxing?
Value Type vs Referecne Type:
- Value type holds a data value within its own memory space; reference type stores the address where the value is being stored
- Value type store its contents on the stack; reference type store its content on the heap

Boxing vs Unboxing
- Boxing is the process of coverting value type variable into reference type variable
- Unboxing is the process of converting reference type variable into value type variable

3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET
- Managed resource are pure .NET code, and code managed by runtime. Anything that lies within .NET framework and .NET framework classes such as string, int, bool variables.
- Umanaged resource are object created outside of .NET libraries and are not managed by runtime, such as COM objects, file streams, connection objects.

4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
- The purpose of Garbage Collector is to manage the allocation and reclaiming of memory.
- When we create any object in C#, common language runtime (CLR) allocate memory for object in heap.
- Since the memory is not unlimited, garbage collector goes to heap, collects unused object and releases related memory.

Controlling Flow and Converting Types
Test your Knowledge

1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
- Program throws a DivideByZeroException exception.
- To prevent this, ensure that the dominator in a division operation with integer of Decimal value is non-zero.

2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
- Dividing a floating-point value by zero doesn't throw an excpetion, it results in positive infinity, negative infinity, or NaN.

3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range?
- In a checked context, integer arithmetic overflow throws OverflowException.
- In an unchecked context, most significant bits are discarded and execution continues. 
- By default, c# does not check for integer arithmetic overflow. We can change this complier option bu enabling "Check for arithmetic overflow/underflow" in Visual Studio
- or use checked and unchecked keywords to override case by case.

4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
- x = y++, assign the value of y to variable x first then increase value y
- x = ++y, increase value y first and the assgin the incremented value to x

5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement?
- break terminates the loop statement and transfer control to the statement that follows loop statment, if any.
- continue starts a new iteration of the loop statement.
- return terminates the execution of function and return function's result, if any.

6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
- Initializer, condition and iterator.
- All the parts are optional, but we cannot omit the semicolens that separate the sections.

7. What is the difference between the = and == operators?
- = assignment operator is used to assign value to a variable
- == equality operator checks whether two operands are equal or not

8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
- Yes, it creates a infinite loop

9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression? Defaults
- switch expression is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed.
- underscore replaces the default keyword to signify that it should match anything if reached "_ =>"

10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach statement?
- IEnumerable interface permits enumeration by using a foreach loop

Arrays and Strings
Test your Knowledge

1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?
- String is immutable. Modifying anying string object will result into creation of a new string object. We use string if it remains constant.
- StringBuilder is mutable. Use StringBuilder if it can change.

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
- Array class

3. How do you sort an array in C#?
- Array.Sort()

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in an array?
- array.Length

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
- An array can be of any data type, but can only hold a single data type in an array.

6. What’s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
- Clone() returns a new array object containing all the elements in the original array.
- CopyTo() copies the elements into another existing array.
- Both of them are shallow copy, each array element contains references to the same object in the original array
